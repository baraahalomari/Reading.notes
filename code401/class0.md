# Solving Problems

There are several key mistakes, The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time by try to start writing code as soon as possible when try to solve programming problem, we should make sure that we take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.
Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.

**A simple set of steps for any algorithm type programming problem.**

*   Read the problem completely twice.

If you don’t understand the problem, You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

*   Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

There is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write,It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate.

*  Optimize the manual steps.

"It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state."

*  Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.

*  Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

*  Optimize the real code.

"This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.  I cannot stress enough how important having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do. This is especially important when you make a mistake!"

This method of tackling a problem is called *“divide and conquer”* and is quite effective.  A good way to know where to break a problem in half is to think about what part of the problem if already given to you would make solving the rest easy.



# Act like you make $1000/hr


> **“Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don’t have enough.” -Grant Cardone.**

> **“Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”**

* If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you.
* As You Think, So You Are

What you think is what you become. If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you’ll begin to act like it. You’ll find yourself saying “yes” to meaningless, pointless obligations.

> **"Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things."**

Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do .



# How to think like a programmer


Problem solving is the meta-skill you can solve any problem by try a solution many times untill it work and If that doesn’t work, keep trying.

> The worst way to solve problems is luck out and that huge waste of time.


Steps when you encounter a new problem:

1. Understand

“If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman

2. Plan

In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

3. Divide

break  big problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. 

4. Stuck?

**Debug:** Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. 

**Reassess:** Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. 

**Research:**  do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).


If anyone want to be a good problem-solver, should solve a lot of problems and practice

> Each time, you’ll learn something.

> Each time, you’ll develop strength, wisdom, and perspective.



# The 5 Whys



**5 WHYS(5Y)** This is a simple but powerful tool for cutting quickly through the outward symptoms of a problem to
reveal its underlying causes, so that you can deal with it once and for all.

You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving It may not be suitable if you need to tackle a complex or critical problem, a wider-ranging method such as Cause and Effect Analysis or Failure Mode and Effects Analysis may be more effective.


## How to Use the 5 Whys

1- **Assemble a Team**

Include someone to act as a facilitator, who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2- **Define the Problem**

observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

3- **Ask the First "Why?"**

Ask your team why the problem is occurring.Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

4- **Ask "Why?" Four More Times**

For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

5- **Know When to Stop**

if you're not sure that you've uncovered the real root cause, consider using a more in-depth problem-solving technique like Cause and Effect Analysis, Root Cause Analysis, or FMEA.)

6- **Address the Root Cause(s)**

discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

7- **Monitor Your Measures**

Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem.
