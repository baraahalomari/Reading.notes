## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource. If the PATCH document is larger than the size of the new version of the resource sent by the PUT method then the PUT method is preferred.

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

An API definition is often used as a baseline for automated tools. API definitions can be used to generate API documentation, code samples, and SDKs automatically. A few examples of tools that generate API documentation (static and interactive) from an API definition file are SwaggerHub and Swagger Inspector. A few examples of tools that can automatically generate sample code and SDKs from API definitions include REST United and SwaggerHub. 

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

SOAP and REST both allow you to create your own API. API stands for Application Programming Interface. It makes it possible to transfer data from an application to other applications. An API receives requests and sends back responses through internet protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and others.

Many popular websites provide public APIs for their users, for example, Google Maps has a public REST API that lets you customize Google Maps with your own content. There are also many APIs that have been created by companies for internal use.

SOAP and REST are two API styles that approach the question of data transmission from a different point of view.
