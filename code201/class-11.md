# IMAGES

we can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS.Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly, we can use CSS to control the dimensions of the images, instead of putting the
dimensions in the HTML.

**There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:**

* The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.
* New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.

**There are two common ways in which we can horizontally center an image:**

* On the containing element, we can use the text-align property with a value of center.
* On the image itself, we can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

The background-image property allows us to place an image behind any HTML element. 

p {

background-image: url("path of img or url");
}

**The background-repeat property can have four values:**

> repeat

>repeat-x

>repeat-y

>no-repeat


When an image is not being repeated, we can use the background-position property to specify where in the
browser window the background image should be placed.


Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves
their mouse over it  and a third style when they click on it.


The gradient is created using the background-image property and, at the time of writing, different browsers required a
different syntax.

If we want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low
contrast in order for the text to be legible.

# Audio and Video Elements

The &lt;video> and &lt;audio> elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages, the HTMLMediaElement API
 provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically.

Because &lt;audio> elements have the same HTMLMediaElement functionality available to them, you could easily get this player to work for an &lt;audio> element too.

Can you work out a way to turn the timer inner &lt;div> element into a true seek bar/scrobbler â€” i.e., when you click somewhere on the bar, it jumps to that relative position in the video playback? As a hint, you can find out the X and Y values of the element's left/right and top/bottom sides via the getBoundingClientRect() method,
 and you can find the coordinates of a mouse click via the event object of the click event, called on the Document object.
