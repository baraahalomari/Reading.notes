# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team


Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound
 forebears could only dream of.

Yet many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­ isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. 
In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate .

faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. 
Google — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — became focused on building the  perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives. 

The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people.
In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. 

No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. 

Some groups that were ranked among Google’s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room.

In 2008, a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College began to try to answer a question very much like this one.

Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.
