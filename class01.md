## How People access the web
the different ways in which people access the web is :
 web browser:People access websites using software  include Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, 
 All websites use HTML and CSS, Some sites also send JavaScript or Flash to your browser.

## HTML
HTML describes the structure of a web page and is stands by Hypertext Marckup Languges

The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets "these are called HTML elements". Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

&lt;head&gt; contains information about the page.

&lt;title>The contents are either shown in the top of the browser.

&lt;body> this element is shown inside the main browser window

## Doctypes
 there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

## Comments
when you come back to the page later (or if someone else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much easier to understand.

&lt;!-- comment goes here -->

## ID attribute
It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page, The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can
be used on any element.

## Class attribute
Its value should describe the class it belongs to. The class attribute on any element can share the same value

## Block Elements
Block elements are used for large sections of text, such as paragraphs, headlines, or lists; and also for some other features such as video players and tables

## Inline Elements
Inline elements do not create a full-width box on the display. They modify the display of text, or insert other things into the text — such as line breaks, images, or hyperlinks.

## Grouping text & Elemments in a block

&lt;div>​ ​— A logical ​div​ision of a page or document Other block elements such as paragraphs, lists, and headers can be nested inside a​ ​&lt;div>

&lt;span>: The &lt;span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the &lt;div> element.

&lt;iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

The &lt;meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

## Headers & Footers

&lt;header> &lt;footer> :The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

&lt;nav> :  is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

&lt;article> :The &lt;article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

&lt;section>:  groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

&lt;hgroup>: The purpose of the &lt;hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more &lt;h1> through &lt;h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.

&lt;a> :This allows you to turn an entire block into a link
Process & Design search and know what the target audience interested about ,consider why people visit your web site by know the reasons  why people would be coming to your site.

organize the information into sections or pages by site map, Before starting creatting our web site we should creating wireframes to ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.

 helps users understand its importance by organizing and prioritizing information on a page .

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow us to divide up the 
parts of a page.  We use tages to help describe the structure of the papage like &lt;head> and &lt;body> 

I used html elements and known uses of its like &lt;header> &lt;footer> &lt;nav>  &lt;section> ...etc

## JavaScript

Importance and function  of JavaScript by allows us to interaction with our web site and modyfing the content by adding element,  and make a 
site feel like it is faster to load and more like an application, even we can

"React: Script triggered when the page loads 
Access: Get each slide from the slideshow 
Modify: Only show the first slide (hide others) 
Program: Set a timer: when to show next slide 
Modify: Change which slide is shown 
React: When user clicks button for different slide 
Program: Determine which slide to show 
Modify: Show the requested slide "


## CSS 

CSS which presentation our web site, and it uses rules to indicate how the element should be displayed, the rules has a selector and a declration block, each declration block has a property.


P { color : blue; }


A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal, which is performed in order o solve the pproblem.

To write a script first of all you need to  you need to define the task you want to  achieve, then design the script by using a flowchart  You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task , finally we can start coading by JavaScript each step.


### How do computers do fit in with the world around them?
 Programmers make models using data, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object and each object has properties and each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells you something about each individual instance of the object.


### METHODS
Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can retrieve or update the values of an object's properties, methods can retrieve or update an
object's properties.


Using the document object, we can access and change what content users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.
document object has:(PROPERTIES, METHODS, EVENTS )

### HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE ?
> The browser recieve an HTML code.

> It create a model of the page and store it in memory.

> It shows page in screen using a rendaring engine.

### To create javascript :
A JavaScript file is just a text file (like HTML and CSS files are) but it has a .js file extension. 


First of all we should known this meaning :


* Vocabulary: The words that computers 
understand 
* Syntax: How you put those words together to 
create instructions computers can follow .
 
To give variables a value by written

var X = 12 ; 


Or we can perform operations on any number of ndividual values which allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

var z = 3 * 9;


> STRING OPERATORS :
Combine two strings 
greeting= 'H'Hi' 'Mothere 
The value of greeting is now Hi Hi there

> COMPARISON OPERATORS :
Compare two values and return true or false

buy = 3 > 5; 

The value of buy is fa false

> LOGICAL OPERATORS :
Combine expressions and return true or false

buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); 

The value of buy is now true

> concatenation :
 you may need to join two or more strings to create a single 
value.
 var firstName = 'Ahmad ' ; 

var lastName = ' Sami ; 

var fullName = fistName + lastName ;
Tle value of fullName = Ahmad Sami
