# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming


  ##  What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency

2. Engaged collaboration

3. Learning from fellow students

4. Social skills

5. Job interview readiness

6. Work environment readiness

 ## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

**Learning from fellow students**

pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution, working with
 a teammate can expose me to techniques that otherwise would not have thought of.

   ## How does pair programming work?

**pair programming commonly involves two roles:** the *Driver* and the *Navigator*. 
The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
 Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, 
and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct 
input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in
 to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
